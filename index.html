    <h1>DevOps: Test Runner Setup</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Mocha is a test framework. It is responsible for running our tests and reporting back which failed.</li>
      <li>Chai is an assertion library. It provides syntactic sugar that makes our Mocha tests look way sweeter.</li>
      <li>Sinon</li>
      <li>Babel transpiles our ES6 code into ES5 for compatibility purposes.</li>
      <li>Istanbul generates our code coverage reports.</li>
      <li>Codecov uploads our Istanbul code coverage reports to the cloud.</li>
      <li>Karma is a test runner. It allows us to run our client side JavaScript tests in real browsers from the command line.</li>
      <li>Karma-mocha Reporter creates Karma test reports that look like Mocha's within the console.</li>
      <li>Saucelabs</li>
